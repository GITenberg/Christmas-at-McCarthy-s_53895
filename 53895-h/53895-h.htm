<div class="adtitle2">New Entertainment Songs<br />

<small>By Edna Randolph Worrell.</small></div>


<p>These songs can be used in all manner of entertainments. The music
is easy, and both music and words are especially catchy. Children like
them. Everybody likes them. Sheet music. Price 25 cents each. Five
copies, $1.00.</p>

<p><b>WE HOPE YOU’VE BROUGHT YOUR SMILES ALONG.</b> A
welcome song that will at once put the audience in a joyous frame of
mind and create a happy impression that will mean half the success of
your entire program. Words, bright and inspiring. Music, catchy.</p>

<p><b>WE’LL NOW HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.</b> This beautiful song
has snap and go that will appeal alike to visitors and singers. It is just
the song to send your audience home with happy memories of the occasion.</p>

<p><b>WE’VE JUST ARRIVED FROM BASHFUL TOWN.</b> This song
will bring memories to the listeners of their own bashful school days.
Words, unusually clever. Music, decidedly melodious. A capital welcome
song, or it may be sung at any time on the program with assured success.</p>

<p><b>MY OWN AMERICA, I LOVE THEE.</b> A song that will bring
a thrill of patriotism to the heart of every one who hears it. The children
and grown-ups just can’t resist the catchy music. It makes a capital
marching song.</p>

<p><b>COME AND PARTAKE OF OUR WELCOME CAKE.</b> A merry
welcome song and a jolly one, too. The audience will be immediately
curious about the Welcome Cake, and the children will love to surprise
the listeners with the catchy words. Music, easy and tuneful.</p>

<p><b>LULLABY LANE.</b> The music and words blend so beautifully that
people will be humming the appealing strains long after they hear this
charming song. A wonderfully effective closing song, whether sung by
the school or as a solo by a little girl, with a chorus of other little girls
with dolls.</p>

<p><b>JOLLY PICKANINNIES.</b> Words by Elizabeth F. Guptill. Music
by Edna R. Worrell. This spicy coon song will bring down the house,
especially if you use the directions for the motions which accompany the
music. The black faces and shining eyes of the pickaninnies will guarantee
a hit. The words are great and the music just right.</p>

<p><b>THE LITTLE BIRD’S SECRET.</b> Here is just the song for those
two little folks to sing together. They won’t have to be coaxed to sing
it, especially when they find that the whole school is to whistle the chorus.
This is a decided novelty, and will prove a rare treat to your audience.</p>

<p><b>A GARDEN ROMANCE.</b> This is a dainty little song telling of the
romance and wedding of Marigold and Sweet William. It is just the
song for dainty little girls to sing.</p>

<p><b>COME TO THE NURSERY RHYME GARDEN AND PLAY.</b>
Here is something different for the little folks to sing. The Nursery
Rhyme Folk are so familiar to children, it will be no trick for them to
remember the words. The music has a most captivating swing.</p>

<h2>SCENE I.</h2>


<p>(<i>Setting—The sidewalk outside of “Murphy’s Tinement.” Have
a couple of low, wide steps, if possible. The children are gathered
on and around these steps. Use plenty of children—as many as
convenient. Small children from two to six or seven may be used
as little brothers and sisters to those who have the speaking parts.
As curtain rises, some of the children are playing “Button, button,”
on the lowest step, and others are playing “Hop-scotch” at one side.
The smallest ones hug dilapidated dollies, rolled up from rags. One
has a small wheel, such as might have been on a little cart, once.
Enter Jimmy and Elsie—hurry along to group.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katie</span>—Sold out so soon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—Ivery blissid paper av thim. Sure, ’twas the swate face
of Ilsie did it. I do be a thinkin’. An’ ivery sowl that bought a
paper, almost, axed quistions about her. Guess they thought she
was a high-born leddy, and me a stealthy, crapy kidnapper. Shure,
an’ she got a foine chanst to be a leddy, and she wouldn’t take it,
at all, at all! Think av that, now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Connie</span>—How could she get a chanst to be a leddy, when she’s
jist a bit av a colleen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleopatra</span>—Ah reck’n he means to be quality. Did some quality
lady wanter stole yer, honey chile?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—Lady wanted to take me ’way fum Jimmy. She said, fere
was mine mutter dat her let me does papers to sell? And I wasn’t
selling dose papers at all! Jimmy was selling ’em. And I telled
her mine mutter was to Himmel gone, and mine fader was all
loss, and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—And she wanted to take her home to be her little gel, ’n
whin I said we couldn’t spare the sunny face av her, she tried to
wheedle her away! Bad ’cess to her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—And she said I wasn’t Jimmy’s little sister at all, she did!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—And she axed, she did, as purry as a cat, could we afford
to kape a growin’ choild that didn’t belong to us, and I says to her,
says I, “Ilsie belongs to the whole tinement, that she does!” And
she axed how that was, and I told her how Mrs. Ferrari slapes her,
and Mrs. Omstrom ates her, and Aunt Bridget washes her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Mrs. Washington minds her, and Mr. Opperman buys her bit
clothes, and you girls kape her tidy, and I buy her hair ribbins, and
she laughed, and called her a communerty orphin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—And I telled her I wasn’t no orfing, I was Jimmy’s little
sister, and she laughed some more, and she said I was pretty, and
she gaved me this. (<i>shows quarter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Micky</span>—Begorra, what a lot av money! It’s a capitalist ye’ll be
afther being, like the Rocky feller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—And thin, bedad, she began to wheedle, and she promised
her foine drisses, and a babby doll, and a cab to wheel it in, and
iverything ye could think about, and more, too, begorry. And thin
if she didn’t up and offer her a Christmas tree!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katie</span>—A Christmas tree! Why didn’t she offer her the earth,
with a noice little pick fince around it? And ye wouldn’t lave us
for a Christmas tree, Elsie darlint?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—“No,” I said, “Jimmy will buy me a Christmas tree a’reddy.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mickey</span>—Like fun he will! Does she think Jimmy’s a millionair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—And she asked where did we live, and I said, “over at the
South side,” says I, and I mutters “over the lift” to mesilf and says
she, “I’m a coming to see yer mother,” she says. And says I, wid
the face av me as sober as a praste, “Me mither’s me ant, for the
rale mither av me’s over in Ould Oirland in a churchyard, where
she’s been iver since jist before I was born, or jist afther, I forgit
which, its so long ago.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—And she laughed, and said she was going to haf her pretty
baby, yet a’retty, but I won’t with that lady go. I will stay with my
Jimmy. Jimmy won’t let her get me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—Don’t worry the golden braids av yer, Ilsie love. I gave
her shtrate way out at the South side that isn’t there at all, at all,
and bedad, she’ll hunt awhile before she finds that addriss, and whin
she does, it’ll be the wrong one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—(<i>confidently</i>) And Jimmy will buy me a Christmas, won’t
you, Jimmy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—Maybe, Ilsie love, a little one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—No, a big one, with a big, big tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caesar</span>—Dar don’t no trees grow in de city, Ailsie honey, not cut
down ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—They grow the stores in. Mine fader always did buy me
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luigi</span>—Maybe we mighta, all togetta, buy a leedla one. I could
de shoesa polish, and get some mon’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caesar</span>—An’ I kin hold de gemman’s hosses, ’n run arrantses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Micky</span>—Let’s all try hard and see if we can’t get Elsie a little
Christmas tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—I don’t a little Christmas want. I wants a big Christmas
and a big tree, like mine fader always did me get.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katie</span>—But you see, Elsie, we’re all poor folks, and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—Jimmy will buy me a Christmas—a big Christmas, and a
big tree. I know he will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Micky</span>—Gee, Jimmy! It’s up to you, all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Opperman</span>—(<i>entering</i>) Vot vos up to Chimmy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caesar</span>—Ter cunjur up a big Christmas tree fo’ Ailsie. She done
boun’ ter have one.</p>

will. I’m Jimmy’s little sister. He did buy for me these hair ribbons
of the blue color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caesar</span>—You’ll half ter do it, Jimmy, whedder or no, as de

<h2>SCENE II.</h2>


<p>(<i>McCarthy’s “fore room,” with “the tree” in the corner. To make
the tree, take three old umbrellas—the skeletons only. They should
be open. Plant the handle of the first one in a tub of earth,
strengthening it, and making it firmer, by four pieces of wire fastened
to the ribs, coming down, obliquely, and anchoring firmly to the
tub. A second umbrella is fastened to the first, the handle of this
one running down by the central wire of the first, and the two
wired firmly together. A third one—and this should be one with
a “crookhandle,” hangs downward from the ceiling, just above the
second. Wire till all is firm and strong, but have the work crude.
This “tree” is draped with green tissue paper, cut into leaves of
every size and shape. Flowers and ornaments of bright tissue paper
adorn it, and to every point is firmly fastened a piece of candle.
The ornaments should be very simple—cut-out hearts, stars, etc.,
paper chains, lanterns, and Jacob’s ladders, etc. At the top is
fastened a large star, covered with the silver foil that comes around
compressed yeast cakes. This should have rays of broomstraws,
also covered with the foil. There should be a great deal of ornament.
Here and there are a few pieces of the gay-colored glass
balls used for decorating Christmas trees. Strings of popcorn and
cranberries also adorn the tree. Hovering over the top is a paper
angel, and at the bottom is a penny picture of the nativity. There
should be a good many penny sticks of candy on the tree, and a few
“oranges” of crepe or tissue paper. A large basket of apples stands
near the tree, while another basket and the floor around are heaped
with “the prisints,” in all sorts of rude bundles. Mr. and Mrs.
McCarthy are alone in the room, giving the last touches to “the
tree.”</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridget</span>—Sure, and it’s one grand evint for Murphy’s tinemint!
Look at thot tree now, will yez? Who but Jimmy wood iver have
thought av it! Sure the Baby’s eyes were full av tears, and she
shtamped the little fut av her, and she says, says she, “Khristhmas
is the twinty-fifth av Dacimber, not the twinty-sixth,” says she.
Ivery buddy do be a saying so, and I won’t have a second hand
Christmas, Jimmy, I won’t. And little cud she know av the high
cost of living. She wud have a big tree, and she would have it
to-night. Bedad, if’t had bin one av me own little spalpeens, I’d
have given her a taste av me hand, where it wud do the most good,
but ye can’t spank an orphin, and I was that distracted I didn’t know
what to do, but Jimmy, he says, says he, pert as an eyster, “We’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
have it the roight night, Ilsie, if it’ll bitter suit yez. And we won’t
have no second hand tree, nuther,” says he. “We’ll have a brand
new, original kind’t nobuddy niver had before.” And Ilsie she
stopped a wapin’, and began to look interested. “And ye must
promise me that ye’re goin’ ter loike it,” he says, ’cause Jimmy’s
plannin’ it all for his little sister, to make her happy.</p>

<p>Sure and ivery one in the tinemint has brought a prisint for
Ilsie, It’s rich she’ll be whin it’s over, I do be a-thinkin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pat</span>—She will that same. And begorry, it is a foine tree, and
ivery choild in the tinemint will injye it, I do be a-thinkin’. Arrah!
here they come! (<i>Voices outside. Jimmy speaks up loudly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—No, no, now. No breakin’ ranks. Kape in yer places,
now, and no crowdin’. It’s two and two ye’re afther goin’ in, as
Noah’s beasties wint inter the Ark. And Ilsie’s a comin’ first,
cause if’t hadn’t bin fer Ilsie there wudn’t a one of ye had a spick
av a Christmas, no more than ye iver did afore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—I want to go in <i>now</i>, Jimmy, I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—Thin knock thray toimes on the dure wit’ yer fairy wand,
and if the little payple have all shcampered out av soight, the dure’ll
open. (<i>Three knocks are heard, Pat swings open the door, and all
march in.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children</span>—Oh! Ah! It’s the beautiful tree!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—Merry Christmas, iverybody!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children</span>—(<i>enthusiastically</i>) Merry Christmas, iverybody! (<i>The
grown people have followed the children into the room. There
should be improvised seats of boxes, barrels, and boards. They
seat themselves, and look expectantly at Elsie.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Elsie buries her face on Jimmy’s shoulder and begins to cry.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—Fhwat ails yez, Ilsie darlint? Tell Jimmy fhwat’s the
matter av ye!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—It—it is <i>not</i> one Christmas tree, aretty. It—it is not one
tree at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—Sure it is. Don’t yez see the green on the branches av it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—(<i>looking up a minute</i>) They is not no branches at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pat</span>—Thin what be they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—I don’t know, but they no branches are, and that no tree is,
whatever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Other Children</span>—(<i>indignantly</i>) It’s a foine tree!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—It is not no tree at all! Jimmy, you did said I should have
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—And you said you wud loike it if Jimmy got it for yez,
and now yez don’t. Oh, Ilsie, pit!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katie</span>—(<i>kneeling by Elsie</i>) Ilsie, darlint, poor Jimmy fales awful
bad. Do yez want him to crry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—I do feel bad, too, Katie. He said I should have a Christmas
tree, he did!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katie</span>—And he got ye one—a foine one! “Sure,” says he, “She’s
had German trees a lot av toimes, but she’s niver had one av this
koind, and bedad, Oi’ll git it fer her, cost it what it will,” says he;
and he’s done it, and now yez don’t loike it! That isn’t a nice
grateful little Ilsie at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—Is it a tree, really Katie—one new kind, aretty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katie</span>—It is thot same, colleen Bawn. It’s—it’s—dear me, I disremember
the name av it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pat</span>—It’s a Pollyglot tree, that’s fhwat it is, and a rare koind, too.
And to think she doosn’t care fer thot same, whin Jimmy got it
be purpose for her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span>—I do like it, aretty. Jimmy, don’t you cry once. It’s a
nice new kind of a tree, and I does like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>—Thin thray cheers fer the grand Christmas tree! (<i>all

they form in line behind others and raise flags, forming long arch.

place, but do not raise flags this time. Next couple repeat this, till
all have done so, and are in place once more.</p>

the other. When they have gone around once this way, they wind
the “grand right and left,” crossing flags with each one met; passing
to the right of the first one met, and to the left of the next
one met. Continue thus around circle.</p>

and forward. When near enough to centre so that flags nearly touch
in a high point, march around in a wheel, then back to places again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>—Boys form line, girls form line in front: of them. Boys
march around end of this line, and form line in front of girls. Girls
do same. Continue as many times as space allows.</p>

<div class="adtitle2">Christmas Entertainments</div>


<p><b>CHRISTMAS AT PUNKIN HOLLER.</b> A new Christmas play by Elizabeth
F. Guptill that abounds in clean, wholesome fun from beginning to end.
It depicts the trials of the teacher of an old-fashioned “deestric school” in
conducting the last rehearsal for the Christmas Entertainment. Some of the
pupils are in “custom,” as big Jake puts it, and “Sandy Claus” is there. The
children go through their parts with gusto and more or less success. May be
given in any schoolroom by any number. Easy to produce. Costumes simple.
Children and grown-ups will be delighted with CHRISTMAS AT PUNKIN
HOLLER. Price, 15 cents.</p>

<p><b>A TOPSY TURVY CHRISTMAS.</b> Another new Christmas play by
Elizabeth F. Guptill. It is decidedly humorous from start to finish. The
characters are strong and at every turn of the play there is a happy surprise
for the audience. The children are tired of “minding,” and the everything being
“just so,” so they start to find a place where they will find things different.
They find it in Topsy Turvy Land, where they have strange experiences.
When at last they have a Topsy Turvy Christmas, they are ready to go home
and be satisfied with things just as they are. May be given in any schoolroom
by any number of children not less than fifteen. In two short scenes.
This clever play will prove a sure winner wherever produced. Price, 15 cents.</p>

<p><b>CHRISTMAS AT McCARTHY’S.</b> Elizabeth P. Guptill. Here is a new
Christmas play for the older children and as many young children as are
available. It combines in a marked degree the gentlest pathos and the most
sparkling humor. Several nationalities are represented in the tenement and
there is opportunity for the introduction of specialties if desired. Circumstances
cause Elsie, the tenement orphan, to believe Jimmy, the newsboy, will
buy her a Christmas present, and it seems it is up to Jimmy to do it. Christmas
is an unknown quantity at the tenement, but all agree that Elsie must not
be disappointed, and plan to have one somehow. The entertainment is given
by the “inhabitints thimsilves,” at McCarthy’s. In the midst of the fun,
Elsie’s lost father walks in, and the finale is a general rejoicing. Price, 25c.</p>

<p><b>EVERGREEN AND HOLLY—SONG AND DRILL.</b> By Elizabeth F.
Guptill. A drill for any even number of boys and girls, or all girls. The
girls carry garlands of evergreen while the boys carry wreaths of the same.
After a spectacular drill and fancy march they all sing a beautiful Christmas
song, which accompanies the drill. Following the song they wind a spiral to
the center of the stage, unwind same and march off. Complete instructions
are given. It is the best Christmas drill ever published; easy to produce and
decidedly novel. Price, 15 cents.</p>

dialogue with an excellent moral, for 3 boys and 4 girls. Price, 5 cents;

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
